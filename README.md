# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component

![Design preview for the Article preview component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only JavaScript I needed for this challenge is to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

The users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon
